# Button Component Fix

This file documents the fix for the button component type error.

## Issue

The `Button` component was missing the `disabled` property in its interface, which caused a type error when used in the `CameraCapture` component.

## Solution

Added the `disabled` property to the `ButtonProps` interface:

```typescript
interface ButtonProps extends React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement>, 
  VariantProps<typeof buttonVariants> {
  asChild?: boolean;
  disabled?: boolean; // Added for CameraCapture component
}
```

This allows the `Button` component to accept the `disabled` property when used in the `CameraCapture` component.
